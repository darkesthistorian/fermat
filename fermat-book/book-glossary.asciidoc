== Quick Glossary

This quick glossary contains many of the terms used in relation to *Fermat*, *blockchain technology* and *crypto world*.

These terms are used throughout the book, so bookmark this for a quick reference.
[address]
address (aka crypto address) ::
    A crypto address looks like this: +1DSrfJdB2AnWaFNgSbv3MZC2m74996JafV+. It consists of an alphanumeric string beginning with a "1" (number one). You use an crypto address to send others crypto currency or to receive it in your wallet.

[block]
block::
    A group of transactions, marked with a timestamp and a fingerprint of the previous block. The block header is hashed to produce a proof of work, thereby validating the transactions. Valid blocks are added to the main blockchain by network consensus.((("block")))

[blockchain]
blockchain::
	A list of validated blocks, each linking to its predecessor all the way to the genesis block.((("blockchain")))
	
[blockchain-tech]
blockchain technology::

[cryptonet]
crypto network::
A peer-to-peer network that propagates crypto transactions and blocks every node running a specific crypto currency protocol.
	
[secret-key]
secret key (aka private key)::
	The secret number that unlocks a crypto currency sent to the corresponding crypto address. A secret key looks like this: +5J76sF8L5jTtzE96r66Sf8cka9y44wdpJjMwCxR3tzLh3ibVPxh+.((("secret key")))((("private key", see="secret key")))

[framework]
framework (software framework)::
In computer programming, a software framework is an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software. A software framework is a universal, reusable software environment that provides particular functionality as part of a larger software platform to facilitate development of software applications, products and solutions. Software frameworks may include support programs, compilers, code libraries, tool sets, and application programming interfaces (APIs) that bring together all the different components to enable development of a project or solution. +

[iot]
The Internet of Things (IoT)::
The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects or "things" embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to collect and exchange data. The Internet of Things allows objects to be sensed and controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure, creating opportunities for more direct integration between the physical world and computer-based systems, and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit.
Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to interoperate within the existing Internet infrastructure. Experts estimate that the IoT will consist of almost 50 billion objects by 2020. +

[transaction]
transaction::
In simple terms, a transfer of crypto currency from one address to another. More precisely, a transaction is a signed data structure expressing a transfer of value. Transactions are transmitted over the crypto network, collected by miners, and included into blocks, made permanent on the blockchain.((("transaction")))

[wallet]
wallet::
Software that holds all your crypto addresses and secret keys. Used to send, receive and store your crypto currency.
